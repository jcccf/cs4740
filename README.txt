CS 4740 Report - Sequence Tagging
Justin Cheng (jc882) , Marcus Lim (mkl65), Yi heng Lee (yl478)

Requirements
- Python 2.7+
- svm_hmm binaries (http://svmlight.joachims.org/svm_struct.html) if you want to use the SVM HMM tagger

Usage:
0. Unzip data files to the "lib/data/" folder (thus creating folder "lib/data/pos_files").  Place svm_hmm binaries in "lib/".  Change directory into "lib/".

For running the baseline:
1. Use POS_baseline.py to run our baseline method.  Generated output is saved as "lib/data/baselinepredictions.pos"

For running our HMM implementation:
1. Use hmm_main.py to run our HMM model.  Generated output is saved as "lib/data/kaggle_hmm.txt".  Line 11 sets the options for the HMM model, and the options are described in the preceding lines.

For running the SVM HMM tagger:
1. Use pipeline.py to run the entire pipeline:
    a. Call Features.py to generate features for training and test data
    b. Call svm_hmm_learn to learn a linear model for the features
	(svm_hmm_learn requires a large amount of memory to run, it can fail if the computer runs out of memory)
    c. Call svm_hmm_classify to generate predictions for test data
    d. Call generate_kaggle.py to interpret output from svm_hmm_classify and generate output in the format for online submission.  
    e. Final output is written to "lib/data/output/" folder.  There are three files: 
        i.   out_*.txt is the raw output generated by svm_hmm_classify
        ii.  model_*.txt is the learned model
        iii. kaggle_*.txt is the output predictions in format suitable for online submission
2. Edit Features.py to choose the types of features to use.  Lines 8-15 lists the types of features used, and can be commented out to include/exclude some types of features.
